[Have used only Train data]

# Approaches:
## 1. CNN based (Both feature extraction and Dense layer for classification)
## 2. DIP (DWT+Segments+LBP) for feature extraction and SVC for classification

## This is a base code structure written for validating both approaches and can be further improvised by working on other techniques.
